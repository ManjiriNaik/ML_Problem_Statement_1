Linear Regression model to predict the housing prices based on various suitable factors.

In real estate markets, predicting housing prices accurately is crucial for buyers, sellers and real estate agents. Housing prices depend on various factors such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, location, age of the property and other amenities. In this problem, we aim to develop a machine learning model using linear regression to predict housing prices based on these features.
